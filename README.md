# YTTitleSuggest
Final Project for the ASTR 330 Course at Yale University

YTTitleSuggest is a Python package that suggests keywords and titles for YouTube. It cleans title data, removes stop words, and lemmatizes them, then trains a Word2Vec model. The model suggests keywords related to given keywords. 

The titles are from 6 years of Youtube Trending data. 

It also utilizes models from OpenAI (ChatGPT 3.5 and Davinci 3.0) to come up with full titles and descriptions.
