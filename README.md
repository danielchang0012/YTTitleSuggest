# YTTitleSuggest
Final Project for ASTR 330 at Yale University

YTTitleSuggest is a Python package that suggests keywords and titles for YouTube. It trains a Word2Vec model using titles from YouTube Trending data over 6 years
and suggests keywords related to a given keyword. 

It also utilizes models from OpenAI (ChatGPT 3.5 and Davinci 3.0) to come up with full titles and descriptions.
